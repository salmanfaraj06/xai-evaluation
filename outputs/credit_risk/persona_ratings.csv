However, it lacks completeness as it does not cover other potential factors that could influence the default risk decision beyond income percentage. In terms of actionability, it does not offer guidance on steps a customer could take to potentially improve their situation. My trust in the explanation is moderate, as it's based on a quantifiable rule, but I'm not fully satisfied due to the lack of a holistic view. It also doesn't fully support my decision needs, as it does not help identify opportunities or provide clear explanations to customers. I need more comprehensive and actionable information to maintain positive customer relationships.""
